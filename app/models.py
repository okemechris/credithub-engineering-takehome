"""ORM models for the loan-servicing slice.

Kept intentionally close to the real platform's shape — including the fact
that money is stored as ``Float``. Treat this as the production schema you've
inherited.

Flow: payments arrive as ``PaymentEvent`` rows (simulated gateway callbacks) in
``pending`` status. Reconciling them — matching to a loan, applying the money,
and ticking the event off — is the candidate's task.
